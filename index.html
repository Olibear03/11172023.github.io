			<p>I recall the time when you were at school and your classmate saw our convo on Tiktok or Messenger then she asked you what kind of pet I am, if my memory is doesn't good you answered "Monkey". Although I can only partially recall those moments I know we laugh one's head off.</p>
			<p>If there's something I admire from you it is your curiosity in serious matters and your unshakable character that never let's you forfeit in any argumentsðŸ˜‚. Also when you turn your problems to God whenever faced with difficulties, you're a great exemplar to me.</p>
			<p>Time flies fast, it's been exactly 4 months now since we met. Yesterday you hardly accept adulthood but today you just turned 19. As you embark on another journey of your life, I wish you good health and luck. Always be kind. May this year be filled with joy and success to you.</p>
